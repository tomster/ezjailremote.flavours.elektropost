This is an `ezjail-remote <https://github.com/tomster/ezjail-remote>`_ flavour that installs the `elektropost recipe <http://erdgeist.org/arts/software/elektropost/>`_, a fully functional IMAP and SMTP server complete with webmail, spam filtering and web based admin interface.

Note that both ezjail-remote and the recipe are `FreeBSD <http://freebsd.org/>`_ specific.
