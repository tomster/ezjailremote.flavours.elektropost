# Rules for tcpserver (ucspi).
#
# To take effect, this file must be compiled like so:
#
# "cat /etc/tcp.smtp | tcprules /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb /etc/tcp.smtp.tmp"
#
# by default we allow connections (though not relaying!) from everywhere:
:allow

#examples to allow relaying from specific networks:
#192.168.0.1:allow,RELAYCLIENT=""
#127.0.0.1:allow,RELAYCLIENT=""
